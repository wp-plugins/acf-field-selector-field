# ACF - Field Selector Field

Welcome to the field selector for Advanced custom fields. For information about the base plugin which is required for the role selector to work, take a look at [ACF on Github](https://github.com/elliotcondon/acf) or the official [ACF Homepage](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/).

This plugin will let you create an input field for selecting one or more custom fields. This is a nice feature to have if you'd like to build a form based on custom fields chosen by users, or for customizing exactly what custom data is shown on the front end for example.
